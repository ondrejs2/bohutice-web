# Goal
The purpose of this repository is to create a new web for the village Bohutice (http://www.bohutice.cz/).

I want to learn, train and deepen my knowledge in the area of front-end technologies such as JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7), React and JSX, LESS, HTML5, webpack, ESLint, stylelint and many others. Maybe Redux and React Router, I'll see how it goes and whether I'll need something like that.

# Credit
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
